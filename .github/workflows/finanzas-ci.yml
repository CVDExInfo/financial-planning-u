  # TODO: Integration tests previously depended on seeded canonical projects data.
  # This job has been removed as part of removing seed:canonical-projects script.
  # If integration tests are needed in the future, they should be reworked to use
  # explicit test fixtures or a new data setup approach that doesn't rely on
  # the canonical-projects seed script.

# Forbidden Rubro Literals
# 
# This file contains literal rubro IDs that should NOT be present in the codebase.
# These are legacy IDs that have been replaced by canonical taxonomy IDs.
# 
# The CI pipeline will fail if any of these strings are found in the code.
# This prevents reintroduction of non-canonical rubro IDs.
#
# Format: One literal per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
#
# NOTE: Only add IDs here that are NOT in the canonical taxonomy.
# Check data/rubros.taxonomy.json before adding to this list.

# Currently no forbidden literals defined
# MOD-PM, mod-pm, MOD-PMO are handled via LEGACY_RUBRO_ID_MAP in canonical-taxonomy.ts
# and should not be blocked as they have valid mappings

# Add forbidden literals here as they are discovered
# Examples:
# INVALID-RUBRO-ID
# OLD-DEPRECATED-ID

# Forbidden Rubro Literals
# 
# This file contains literal rubro IDs that should NOT be present in the codebase.
# These are legacy IDs that have been replaced by canonical taxonomy IDs.
# 
# The CI pipeline will fail if any of these strings are found in the code.
# This prevents reintroduction of non-canonical rubro IDs.
#
# Format: One literal per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored

# Legacy MOD-PM variants (replaced with MOD-LEAD)
MOD-PM
mod-pm
MOD-PMO
mod-pmo

# Legacy project manager variants (should use MOD-LEAD)
mod-pm-project-manager

# Add other forbidden literals here as they are discovered
# Examples:
# RUBRO-INVALID
# OLD-RUBRO-ID

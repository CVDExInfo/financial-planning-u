# Forbidden Rubro Literals
# 
# NOTE: This file is no longer used for CI checks.
# 
# The CI pipeline now automatically checks for ANY rubro ID that is NOT
# in data/rubros.taxonomy.json and flags it as a violation.
# 
# This provides automatic validation without needing to maintain a
# manual forbidden list.
#
# The check works by:
# 1. Loading all canonical IDs from data/rubros.taxonomy.json
# 2. Scanning source code for rubro-like patterns (e.g., MOD-*, GSV-*, etc.)
# 3. Flagging any IDs found in code that are NOT in the canonical taxonomy
#
# If you need to use legacy IDs for backward compatibility:
# - Add them to LEGACY_RUBRO_ID_MAP in canonical-taxonomy.ts
# - The mapping will be allowed and documented
#
# If a rubro is missing from the taxonomy:
# - Add it to data/rubros.taxonomy.json
# - The CI check will automatically recognize it as valid
